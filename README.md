# Simple Big Data Processing with MapReduce

On this Repo, We will simulate how to simply use MRJob (MapReduce library in Python)

The idea is : I have txt file which consist of thousand lines containing words, and I'd like to have count of each word

You can follow below instruction :
1. Create mapper and reducer function in `word_count_job.py` 
2. `benda.txt` is file that we would like to count
3. After you create `word_count_job.py`, we can simply run `python word_count_job.py benda.txt > output_file.txt` on your terminal
4. the result of counting words is generate into `output_file.txt`
